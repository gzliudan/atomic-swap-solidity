### Motivation

Our goal is to create a contract that enables users to trade their tokens smoothly and securely.

### Definitions

- `Atomic Swap`: Think of it as a token trade that's quite straightforward â€“ it either goes through as planned or doesn't happen at all. There are no other outcomes.
- `Order`: This is when a user proposes a trade, saying, "I'm willing to exchange a certain amount of token A for a certain amount of token B." To ensure safety, the tokens involved are kept secure within the contract until the trade is finalized.
- `Maker`: The maker is the user who initiates the trade, taking the first step in the process.
- `Taker`: The taker, on the other hand, is the user who responds to an existing trade, essentially becoming the trade's counterpart.
- `Bid`: Here, the taker has the option to make a different offer on the maker's original trade. For instance, if User A offers to trade X amount of token A for Y amount of token B, User B can make a bid, suggesting to trade X for Y minus 10. This introduces some flexibility into the trading process.

### Objectives

- `Permissionless`: The system operates without the involvement of third parties or any form of control over funds and transactions.
  Guarantee of Desired Exchange: Users can trust that the contract ensures a fair exchange, preventing instances where a user receives tokens without the corresponding promised exchange.
- `Escrow Enabled`: The contract is equipped with an escrow mechanism, securely holding tokens to facilitate exchanges.
- `Refundable`: Tokens are refundable from the escrow under specific conditions, such as timeouts or order/bid cancellations.
- `Order Cancellation`: Users have the flexibility to cancel orders at any time, provided they have not yet been taken.
- `Atomicity`: The contract guarantees that each token exchange is an all-or-nothing affair, either being a complete success or an utter failure, with no middle ground.
- `Bid Management`: To create a system that enables users to actively bid on existing orders, granting makers the freedom to select bids of their preference for order completion.

### User roles

- Maker: The maker is the user who initiates the trade, taking the first step in the process.
- Taker: The taker,on the other hand, is the user who responds to an existing trade, essentially becoming the trade's counterpart.
- Bidder: The taker who offer a different price for an order.

### Order creation and execution

#### Making a swap

1. A maker creates an order transaction with selling tokens and the price.
2. The maker's sell tokens are sent to the contract.
3. The order is saved in contract.
4. In the event of an order expiration, a refund of the tokens held in contract will be initiated. However, it's important to note that the user must manually trigger this refund process through a "cancelswap" operation, as the contract does not automatically execute it.

#### Taking a swap

1. A taker takes an order by sending a `TakeSwap` transaction.
2. The taker's sell tokens are sent to the escrow address owned by the contract.
3. # if the taker's price is equate to order's price ,the contract sending Maker's selling tokens to taker and sending Taker's selling Token to maker. otherwise reject the take transaction and refund the taker's token.
4. A taker takes an order by sending a `TakeSwap` transaction for a specific order.
5. The taker's sell tokens are sent to the escrow address owned by the contract.
6. If the taker's offered price matches the price specified in the order, the contract facilitates the exchange by transferring the maker's selling tokens to the taker and the taker's selling tokens to the maker. However, if the prices do not align, the contract will reject the "TakeSwap" transaction and promptly refund the taker's tokens.
   > > > > > > > main
7. An order cannot be taken if the current time is later than the `expiredAt`.

#### Cancelling a swap

1.  A maker cancels a previously created order. Expired orders can also be cancelled.
    <<<<<<< HEAD
2.  # An Order can only be cancelled once.
3.  An order can only be cancelled once.
    > > > > > > > main
4.  Tokens should be refunded when order is cancelled.
5.  An order can be cancelled by the maker at any time, even if there are outstanding, incomplete bidding orders associated with it.
6.  Maker should not be able to accept a bid order if the order has been canceled.

### Data struct and types

- Order:

```ts
interface Coin {
  token: string;
  amount: number;
}
interface AtomicSwapOrder {
  id: string;
  status: status;
  maker: string;
  taker: string;
  sellToken: Coin;
  buyToken: Coin;
  highestBid: string;
  minBidCap: number;
  // evm block timestamp
  createdAt: number;
  canceledAt: number;
  completedAt: number;
}
```

- Make Transaction

```ts
interface MakeSwapMsg {
  // the tokens to be exchanged
  sellToken: Coin;
  buyToken: Coin;
  // the maker's address
  maker: string;
  // if desiredTaker is specified,
  // only the desiredTaker is allowed to take this order
  // this is the address on the taker chain
  acceptBid: boolean;
  minBidAmount: number;
  desiredTaker: string;
  createdAt: number;
  expiredAt: number;
}
```

- Take Transaction

```ts
interface TakeSwapMsg {
  orderID: string;
  // the tokens to be sold
  sellToken: Coin;
  // taker can setup custom address to receive token. we will open this for future development and integration with other protocols.
  takerReceiver: string;
  createdAt: number;
}
```

- Cancel Transaction

```ts
interface CancelSwapMsg {
  orderID: string;
}
```

### Bid process

** Properties **:

- Anyone can bid for any open orders. if the order has specified desired recipient, then only he can bid for this old.
- bid price should great than `minBidAmount` and less than order price
  - makers can set price limit for bids for their order. For example: minimum price for token X: 100
- bider should able to specified a duration for this offering. Maker can only accept the bid in that time window.
- Don't support partial bid for now.
- Unfinished bid order should be allowed to claim it's assets back

** Process **

- When the maker directly specifies a preferred taker, that taker can accept the order without competition. Otherwise, all other takers must participate in a bidding process.
- Taker pick a order (he is interested),
- Input a price and duration(should be equal or above minimum limit: if specified) and price will be less or same than buy price.
- Deposit required tokens
- Submit the bider order.
- Maker receive bider orders and decide if she/he want to accept the price.

```ts
interface PlaceBidMsg {
  orderID: string;
  status: string; // 1. waiting for accept, 2. complete, 3.cancel
  bidAmount: number;
  duration: u64;
  completedAt: u64;
  createdAt: u64;
}

interface AcceptBidMsg {
  orderID: string;
}
```

```ts
interface TakeBidMsg {
  orderID: string;
  bidder: string;
}
```

```ts
interface CancelBidMsg {
  orderID: string;
  bidder: string;
}
```

### Fees

- Maker fee: 0.1%
- Take fee: 0.12%
- When a maker creates an order, calculate the maker fee based on the order's value.
- When a taker executes a trade, calculate the taker fee based on the order's value.
- Deducted fees will be sent to treasury account

### Escrow mechanism

- Maker send tokens to contract and locked.
